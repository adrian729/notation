# Illustrations: medieval / renaissance, free

Research date 2026-09-30. Nothing downloaded. "Free" = usable in this public repo and in a possibly commercial app. Each source below says what you get, how to find it, and which pipeline (A–D) turns it into a project asset.

## Quick start

| I want… | Go to | Pipeline |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dividers, fleurons, corner pieces (tintable) | [British Library Flickr: Decorations & Designs](https://www.flickr.com/photos/britishlibrary/albums/72157638797895895/), [publicdomainvectors](https://publicdomainvectors.org/en/free-decorative-vector-ornaments) | B (BL scans), A (vectors) |
| Decorated initials (tintable, woodcut look) | Wikimedia Commons: Ratdolt / incunabula initials, Kelmscott Chaucer | B |
| Illuminated initials, borders, marginalia (colour) | [Digital Walters](https://thedigitalwalters.org/01_ACCESS_WALTERS_MANUSCRIPTS.html), [Getty](https://search.getty.edu/gateway/landing) | C |
| Musicians and instruments (colour) | [Commons: Codex of the musicians](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Codex_of_the_musicians) (Cantigas) | C |
| Small object icons (lute, quill, scroll) | [game-icons.net](https://game-icons.net) | A |
| Printers' flowers as text | IM Fell Flowers font | D |

## Pipelines: getting an asset into the project

All assets go under `apps/app/src/assets/illustrations/<kind>/` (e.g. `ornaments/`, `initials/`, `figures/`), with one `CREDITS.txt` in `illustrations/` listing file → source URL → licence (same idea as `public/samples/piano/CREDITS.txt`). Name files by what they are (`divider-vine.svg`, `initial-a-ratdolt.svg`), not by source id.

Tools: `cwebp` and Python Pillow are installed; `potrace`, `svgo` and ImageMagick are not (`brew install potrace imagemagick`, `pnpm dlx svgo`).

### A. Ready-made SVG

1. Download the SVG.
2. Clean: `pnpm dlx svgo --multipass in.svg -o out.svg`; remove hard-coded `fill`/`stroke` colours (or set them to `currentColor`).
3. Commit under `illustrations/<kind>/`, add a `CREDITS.txt` line.
4. Use in CSS as a mask so it takes a token colour: `mask: url(...) center / contain no-repeat; background-color: var(--color-muted-foreground)`; or import with `?raw` and inline it.

### B. Line-art scan → tintable SVG (woodcuts, printers' ornaments, one-colour initials)

1. Download the largest available image (≥ 1500 px on the long side if possible).
2. Crop tightly to one ornament (any image editor, or Pillow `Image.crop`).
3. Convert to pure black/white: greyscale + threshold (Pillow `convert('L').point(lambda p: 255 if p > 140 else 0)`; tune the threshold so parchment disappears and thin lines survive). Save as `.pbm` / `.bmp`.
4. Trace: `potrace in.pbm -s -o out.svg` (`-t 5` drops specks, `-a 1` smooths corners).
5. Continue with pipeline A steps 2–4.

### C. Colour image (illuminations, miniatures)

1. Download the largest image (Walters 1800 px JPEG is enough for web).
2. Crop to the detail you want; knock out the background only if placing on the paper texture (otherwise keep the parchment as a framed picture).
3. Resize to ~2× the displayed size, then `cwebp -q 80 in.png -o out.webp`.
4. Commit under `illustrations/<kind>/`, add a `CREDITS.txt` line; import in React (`import url from '...webp'`) with `loading="lazy"`; in dark mode frame it or lower opacity.

### D. Ornament font

1. Download the font; check its bundled licence file.
2. Subset to the glyphs used and convert to WOFF2 (`pyftsubset` from fonttools, same tooling as `packages/notation-fonts`).
3. Add an `@font-face` + token in `apps/app/src/styles/theme.css`; render the glyphs as text (they then follow `color` and dark mode automatically).

## Not usable (or only under conditions)

- **Vectorian ornaments** ([svgornaments](https://github.com/cionx/svgornaments), [pgfornament](https://ctan.org/pkg/pgfornament), [vectorian.net](https://www.vectorian.net/free-vintage-vectors.html)): the Vectorian licence forbids redistributing them "in any format that will allow a third party to access to the images in digital vector format", SVG included. Committing SVGs to a public repo or serving them to browsers breaks that. Only usable rasterised (PNG/WebP). The pgfornament LaTeX package itself is LPPL 1.3. The [catalogue PDF](https://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/tkz/pgfornament/doc/ornaments.pdf) is still useful for ideas.
- **Bodleian Digital, e-codices**: CC BY-NC, non-commercial only.
- **Gallica (BnF)**: free for non-commercial use; commercial reuse needs a paid BnF licence.
- **Morgan Library**: no open licence; permission per image.

## Licence notes

- **CC0 / public domain**: no credit required; still list the source in `CREDITS.txt` so the origin is traceable.
- **CC BY** (game-icons): credit required.
- **CC BY-SA** (Heidelberg): credit required; derived images stay CC BY-SA.
- **Wikimedia Commons**: licence is per file; photos of 2D public-domain art are usually PD-Art, but some uploads carry a photographer's licence.

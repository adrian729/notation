# E1 Interval Comparison

Product spec for Polyhymnia's version of EarMaster's Interval Comparison (`docs/earmaster.md` E1). Tags: **[EM]** = matches documented EarMaster behaviour (source in `docs/earmaster.md` or the URL given); **[ours]** = EarMaster is undocumented here, so this is our decision.

Implementation: `apps/app/src/exercises/interval-comparison/` (pure logic) and `apps/app/src/routes/exercises/interval-comparison/` (screens). Logic shared with E2 lives in `apps/app/src/exercises/shared/`. Nothing in `packages/*` changes.

## Plays

- Two intervals, **A then B**, in one playing mode shared by both: ascending, descending or harmonic [EM, the common-tone option text implies one mode per question].
- Melodic: each tone lasts one note length (tempo option), no gap between the two tones of an interval [ours].
- Harmonic: both tones together for two note lengths [ours].
- Silence of one note length between A and B [ours].
- The question plays automatically when it appears. **Play question** replays the whole A–B pair; there is no separate replay of A or B [EM: only "Play Question" is documented].

## Shows

- Before answering: the instruction "Which interval is larger, or are they the same?", the **A**, **Same** and **B** buttons, **Play question**, and in lessons the progress bar. No staff [EM: the staff only shows the tones after answering and is never an input].
- The answer buttons are disabled until the question has started playing [ours].

## Answer

- Press **A** or **B** (mouse, touch, or keys `A` / `B`) [EM: "Choose A with the mouse or on the keyboard"].
- Press **Same** (key `S`) when A and B are the same size [ours; EarMaster's answer is binary and it never generates ties].
- One answer per question; it is evaluated immediately [EM F15].
- Anything that ends the question (answering, **Finish** in endless mode, or leaving) stops the sound immediately; **Play question** can replay it afterwards [ours].

## Options

Custom exercise (all options) [EM, E1 options]; workshop lessons fix them.

| Option | Values | Tag |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Intervals | Any of m2, M2, m3, M3, P4, TT, P5, m6, M6, m7, M7, P8 and compound m9 … P15 (13–24 semitones); at least two sizes | EM |
| Playing mode | Any of ascending, descending, harmonic; random among the selected, per question | EM |
| Tone relationship | Common first tone · Common first or second tone · Nearby first tones · Random first tones | EM (names from the workshop; "Random first tones" is ours, replacing EM's "No common tones") |
| Range | Lowest and highest tone any question may use | ours (replaces EarMaster's keys and root movement) |
| Tempo | Slow, medium, fast note length (1.0 s, 0.7 s, 0.45 s) | EM (shared tempo option), values ours |
| Questions | A whole number from 1 to 200 (number input, with -10/-1/+1/+10 steppers), or endless | ours |
| Auto new question | Off, or after a correct answer (1.5 s, shown as a countdown bar on a **Stay** button that cancels it for the current question; replaying restarts the countdown) | EM F12, Stay ours |

Keys and root movement are simplified to a range: EarMaster's key options matter for tonal context, which E1 does not use.

The custom exercise screen explains every option inline, reusing the lesson help text. Intervals are picked one by one or with interval sets (Perfect, Imperfect consonant, Dissonant, All intervals) that add or remove their whole group, so sets combine; a **Second octave** toggle adds the same intervals one octave wider (m3 → m10, P8 → P15), removes all compound intervals when turned off, and makes sets picked while it is on cover both octaves. Names show in full ("Major 3rd", "Octave", "Double octave") by default, with a toggle for abbreviations. The number of questions is a −/+ stepper with an editable value (1–200), quick picks 10 · 20 · 30 · 50 and an **Endless** toggle; after a correct answer the run either waits or continues automatically. The last-used custom options and the name toggle are remembered in the browser (`localStorage`) and restored next time the page opens with no options chosen yet; a **Reset to defaults** button clears back to the defaults above [ours].

## Question choice

- Mode: uniform among the enabled modes [EM].
- Sizes: A and B are each drawn uniformly from the enabled set; when B lands on the same size as A it is drawn once more, so they are the same size with probability 1 ÷ (number of enabled sizes)²; the exact same pair and order never repeats back to back [ours].
- Roots, by tone relationship. The **first tone** is the tone played first: the lower tone for ascending and harmonic, the upper tone for descending [EM: "melodic down … the top tone in common"].
  - Common first tone: A and B share their first tone [EM].
  - Common first or second tone: A and B share either their first tone or their second tone, 50/50 [ours; EarMaster names the lesson but does not define it].
  - Nearby first tones: first tones drawn at random 0–4 semitones apart; they may coincide [ours].
  - Random first tones: A and B start on independent random notes in the range; they may share pitches [ours].
- All four tones stay inside the range; otherwise the choice is redrawn [ours].
- Spelling: every interval is spelled correctly from its first tone (letter distance plus quality, e.g. M3 above E♭ is G). First tones use the spellings C, C♯, D, E♭, E, F, F♯, G, A♭, A, B♭, B, respelled enharmonically when the other tone would need a double accidental. A shared tone has the same spelling in both intervals. The tritone is spelled A4 or d5, whichever avoids double accidentals [ours].

## Feedback / scoring

- After answering, the chosen button turns green if right or red if wrong; the correct button is always green [EM F16].
- The instruction line says "Correct: B was larger", "Wrong: A was larger" or "Correct: A and B were the same size" [ours wording].
- Reveal: both intervals on their own staff, stacked (A above B) at a large, fixed size, labelled **A** and **B** with their name and direction (e.g. "Major 3rd, ascending"). Clef: treble unless the question's middle tone lies below C4, then bass [EM shows tones; labels and names ours].
- Play question still works after answering. **Next question** (`Enter`) continues [EM behaviour; EarMaster labels it "New question"].
- Question score: right or wrong. Lesson or session score: right answers ÷ questions asked, as a percentage [EM F15].
- Progress bar (any fixed-length run, lesson or custom): one segment per question, grey upcoming, pink (primary) current, green (success) right, red (destructive) wrong [EM F5, current]. Endless runs show no progress bar; instead a **Finish** button ends the session at any point [ours].
- Every finished session — lesson, custom, or an endless run ended with **Finish** — shows the score and a review of every question asked, each with a **Replay** button. Only lessons additionally show a passed/not passed badge [ours].

## Levels

Workshop: 20 modules = 5 interval families × 4 tone relationships, each with an ascending, a descending, a harmonic and a mixed lesson (mixed picks a mode uniformly per question, same as Question choice), 80 lessons in all [EM S9 structure; exact lesson names undocumented, names ours].

| Family | Intervals |
| --- | --- |
| Perfect | P4, P5, P8 |
| Imperfect consonant | m3, M3, m6, M6 |
| Dissonant | m2, M2, TT, m7, M7 |
| All simple | m2 … P8 |
| Compound | m9 … P15 |

- Module order: family by family, and inside each family the relationships in the order listed under Question choice (common first tone is easiest) [ours].
- Lesson rules [ours]: a lesson asks exactly its number of questions (10), never more, then shows the score. It is passed at 80% or more (used for the passed mark and the suggested next lesson). Custom runs ask exactly the selected number, show the score and the per-question review, and are never graded. EarMaster's supplementary questions (F3) are deliberately not copied.
- After the lesson, a summary shows the score, passed or not, and **Retake**, **Next lesson** (suggested when passed) and **Back to lessons** [EM F6], followed by a review of every question asked: both intervals stacked, at exactly the same size as the in-lesson reveal, framed green (success) if answered correctly or red (destructive) if not, each with a **Replay** button that plays the same A–B pair again [ours].
- Range per lesson: C3–C6 for simple families, G2–C6 for compound [ours].
- The lesson list shows each lesson's best score and a passed mark, stored locally in the browser [EM F7, simplified].
- Not copied: stricter end-of-module test lessons, adaptive questions (F4), per-interval statistics.

## Notes

- Needs no theory, so it is the recommended first exercise [EM].
- Keyboard: `A`, `S` (same), `B` answer; `Space` plays the question; `Enter` goes to the next question once answered [ours; EarMaster's F5/F6/F7/F8 shortcuts do not suit a browser].
- Harmonic seconds must render with side-by-side noteheads; if they don't, that is a `notation-engine` gap to report, not something to work around in the app.
